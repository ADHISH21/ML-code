Movie Recommendation ML Model

A Content based Movie Recommendation System using Python,Streamlit while leveraging various modules like scikit, ast, pandas etc.
This ML model considers various data attributes and creates relevancy tags and calculates cosine similarity to give best possible recommendations.

**AIM**

Recommendation systems are essential in today's digital age to help users discover relevant content. They analyze user preferences and behaviors to provide personalized recommendations.
Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches are commonly used techniques in recommendation systems. 
Understanding these techniques is crucial for optimizing movie recommendations.

**EVALUATION METRICS USED**

Use of various mathematics modules to analyze similarity and establish relationships between movies to provide users with an all round experience.
Functions used are TfIdVectorizer() and cosinesimmilarity() to generate Evaluation matrices to detect and identify patterns between movies.

**WORK FLOW AND METHODOLOGY**

The work flow used in this project involves using ML functions and functions which involves converting textual data into vectors to perform similarity calculations. 
This project uses basics of NLP to detect the names of movies from incorrect user inputs and then convert into vectors to perform similarity calculations on various parameters like:
  1)genres cast
  2)directors
  3)Overall feel 
  4)story of the movie

**RESULTS AND INFERENCES**

The recommendation system is a mix of data preprocessing as well as using ML modules to establish patterns and similarities.
Cleaning datasets to applying ML models onto the dataset enabled us to understand the underlying mathematical complexity.
The project was an all round data visualization and pattern recognition avenue towards making a self sufficient program which enhances user experience.
